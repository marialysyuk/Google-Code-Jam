The brief idea of the solution:

In the first two test sets the price of both CJs and JCs is positive, therefore the goal is to minimize the total amount of CJs and JCs. If there are '?' signs 
in the beginning or in the end, they are fulfilled with corresponding first non-'?' letter in the beginning or with the last one in the end (for instance, ??CJ??
is changed to CCCJJJ). In other cases, appearance of CJs or JCs is inevitable since some letters are in place and can't be removed. Therefore, it's left to 
calculate the amount of CJs and JCs that are left when all '?' signs are removed.
